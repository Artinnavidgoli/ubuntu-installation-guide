# ubuntu-installation-guide
hello guys this is a installation guide for ubuntu + there is a guide for virtual installation and dual-boot installation guide too 😀

****

## What you’ll need

- A laptop or PC (obviously!) with at least 25GB of storage space. (if you want a fast desktop experince , it's better to use SSD for you hard-drive) and also you can see Ubuntu certified hardware [here](https://ubuntu.com/certified?q=&limit=20&category=Desktop&category=Laptop)

- The ram (memmory) need to be at least 4GB . (my recommendation is to use at least 8GB)

- A flash drive or a DVD disk .the installation guid for installing from a DVD is [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/burn-a-dvd-on-windows#1-overview).(8GB as a minimum, 12GB or above recommended and keep in mind using usb 3.0 is a faster installation).

- A ubuntu ISO file that you can download from [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) . (use LTS version if you don't want to have crazy problems 😵‍💫)

- Download [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [balena etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher)

=> note: if you want to do virtual installation you don't need a flash drive (or Create bootable USB drives) but ,you'll need a softwere like vmwere or virtualbox .

#### simple ubuntu installation

1. first bootable the USB drive.👇

![first step](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/a40f15d2-select-iso.png?_ga=2.100016350.152429071.1674276244-235291734.1674276244)


2.now it's the time for booting into USB drive .

Insert the USB flash drive into the laptop or PC you want to use to install Ubuntu and boot or restart the device. It should recognise the installation media automatically. If not, try holding F12 during startup and selecting the USB device from the system-specific boot menu.

=> note: F12 is the most common key for bringing up your system’s boot menu, but Escape, F2 and F10 are common alternatives. If you’re unsure, look for a brief message when your system starts – this will often inform you of which key to press to bring up the boot menu. (keep in mind that I have a lenovo laptop so ,the boot menu for lenovo is F12)

if you done it perfectly you will see this welcoming screen.👇

=> note: press " install ubuntu " and then chosse you keyboard language
