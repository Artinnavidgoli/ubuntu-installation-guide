# ubuntu-installation-guide
hello guys this is a installation guide for ubuntu + there is a guide for virtual installation and dual-boot installation guide too 😀

****

## What you’ll need

- A laptop or PC (obviously!) with at least 25GB of storage space. (if you want a fast desktop experince , it's better to use SSD for you hard-drive) and also you can see Ubuntu certified hardware [here](https://ubuntu.com/certified?q=&limit=20&category=Desktop&category=Laptop)

- The ram (memmory) need to be at least 4GB . (my recommendation is to use at least 8GB)

- A flash drive (8GB as a minimum, 12GB or above recommended and keep in mind using usb 3.0 is a faster installation).

- A ubuntu ISO file that you can download from [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) . (use LTS version if you don't want to have crazy problems 😵‍💫)


** note: if you want to do virtual installation you don't need a flash drive but you will need a softwere like vmwere or virtualbox **
